        <h2>
          Axiom is a Collective of artists with unique styles connected through
          a passion for underground music
        </h2>
        <h2>
          the core values of this collective are; kindness towards one another,
          the pure unfiltered love of music (and art), honesty, constructive not
          destructive criticism, and finally creativity over money, business,
          attention and everything superficial (that way our work will always
          have spirit).
